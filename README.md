## Where to Find Help and Resources

- Infrastructure
  - [Docker][dk]
  - [Docker-Compose][dkc]
  - [NodeJS v12+][nd]

## Run Postgres and Adminer using Docker

[PostgreSQL][pg] is a famous relational and document database, [Adminer][adm] is a web-based database manager tool that let you explore your db visually.

We can run both services using [Docker-Compose][dkc] and make the commands a bit easier to write in our console by describing them in a [Makefile][mkf].

### Videos

- [Setup Postgres With Docker (3:12)](./videos/docker-compose-postgres.mp4)
- [Login to the Adminer web interface (1:33)](./videos/docker-compose-adminer.mp4)
- [Access PSQL from your Terminal (1:09)](./videos/docker-compose-psql.mp4)

### Project's API

The Project's CLI API are:

```bash
# Pull Docker images and start the infrastructure
make start

# Stop any running container
make stop

# Remove al containers and memory
make clean
```

### Connect to Adminer

Assuming you run the project with the default ports, you can access [Adminer][adm] with your browser:

```
http://localhost:8008
```

And basically login using `postgres` everywhere:

### Connect to PSQL

[PostgreSQL][pg] ships a powerful CLI client called [PSQL][psql], and sometimes it is just easier to use a Terminal than it is to run a web interface.

Although you can install it into your machine, you can also just run it via [Docker-Compose][dkc] targeting the running database container:

```bash
# Start a PSQL session with default credentials
make psql

# Start it with a custom password
# (in case you changed it into the docker-compose.yaml)
make psql pg_password=foobar
```

Once you gain access to the PSQL client, you can issue both SQL and PSQL commands.

```bash
# SQL Command:
select now();

# PSQL Command:
quit
\q
```

## Folder Structure, Features, and Services

A ForrestJS project is based on [NodeJS][nd] and can be easily initialized using the [NPM][npm] command:

```bash
npm init
```

Once you go through, you can then structure your project this way:

```
- root
  - package.json
  - src
    - index.js
    - features/
    - services/
```

### Videos

- [Walk Through a ForrestJS Project Structure (4:43)](./videos/folder-structure.mp4)

### The Project's Root

> The **root folder** is where you store your `package.json` file.

In the root folder of a ForrestJS/NodeJS App you find mostly configuration and documentation files:

- project's manifest
- testing environment setup
- editor setup files
- docker-compose for running infrastructural dependencies

### The Project's Manifest

The file `package.json` should contain all the information that are needed to recreate a correct running state for the project:

- dependencies
- commands

I suggest you always provide an `npm start` interface for running your project in **development mode**.

> **Remember:** your developers are the first and most affectionated users of your App!

### The Source Folder

All the JavaScript files go into `/src` for two main reasons:

1. most people do that
2. you may want to use [TypeScript][ts] so your files need transpiling

Anyway, if you ever face a bug that need fixing, it's likely inside this folder.

### The App's Manifest

The file `src/index.js` is the entry point for your App, and in a ForrestJS App take the fancy name of **App Manifest**.

That's because it holds a few **declararive** responsibilities:

- It describes the App's environment
- It describes the App's configuration
- It describes the App's composition  
  <small>of Services and Features</small>

### Services & Features

The beauty of a ForrestJS App lays in its composability and interoperability of Features and Services.

A **Feature** represents a bit of business value, something that your customer is happy to pay for.

> The capability of listing and creating Todos is a good Feature.

A **Service** represents a bit of infrastructural value, something that _YOU_ need to work out your Features, but that the customer is not really interested into.

> The capability of connecting to a PostgreSQL database is a good Service.

## Run a ForrestJS App with Nodemon

### Videos

- [Install dependencies from NPM (1:13)](./videos/run-forrest-add-dependencies.mp4)
- [Create a Start Script (1:27)](./videos/run-forrest-npm-start.mp4)
- [Start your first ForrestJS App (1:46)](./videos/run-forrest-start.mp4)

### Add ForrestJS and Nodemon

Add [ForrestJS Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@forrestjs/core) as a project's dependency:

```bash
npm add @forrestjs/core
```

Add [Nodemon][nm] as a development dependency:

```bash
npm add -D nodemon
```

### Add the Start Script

We can use [Nodemon][nm] to start our App and automatically track changes that we make to the codebase.

Modify `package.json` as follow:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon src/index.js"
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ [Checkout the source code](https://github.com/forrestjs/workshop-api/blob/run-with-nodemon/package.json#L6)

Now you can start your App:

```bash
npm start
```

### Run a ForrestJS App

Here is a basic ForrestJS App Manifest scaffold that you can paste into your `src/index.js`:

```js
// Import Core, Services, and Features
const forrestjs = require("@forrestjs/core");

// Kick off a ForrestJS App
const app = forrestjs.run();

// Handle the Boot of the App
app.then(() => console.log("The app started"));
app.catch(console.error);
```

## Setup Prettier

[Prettier][prettier] is an _opinionated code formatter_ that makes it easier to produce readable and congruent source code.

You can install the extension to [VSCode][vscode] here:  
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode

Then you can setup your rules in the `.prettierc` file:

```json
{
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ [Checkout the source code](https://github.com/forrestjs/workshop-api/blob/prettierc/.prettierc)

And finally activate the on-save hook in your [VSCode][vscode] settings `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "files.eol": "\n"
}
```
